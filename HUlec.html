							<h2> 2022</h2>

							
							<h2>Course Description</h2>
					<p>In today's society, we see news articles and TV programs about environmental and resource problems almost every day, and the extent of these problems seems only getting worse and worse. This course provides the methods economists use to address environmental issues.  These methods include Pigovian taxes and subsidies, tradable permits, private provision of public goods, and optimal stock control of natural resources (such as fishery and forestry).   During the course, I occasionally ask students to discuss various topics on environmental sustainability within small groups.  Course requirements include two written assignments (problem sets) as well as midterm and final exams.</p>
					
					<h2>Prerequisites and Grading</h2>
					<p>I assume students in this class have successfully completed at least one introductory economics course.
						If you have not and still want to take this course, I recommend you to enroll introductory microeconomics course
						during this semester.  </p>
					<p> Don't forget that class participation is a key to your grade.  Your final grade will be decided based on the following weight.</p>
					
					<h3>EEP I</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> written assignments: 20%</li>
						<li> class participation: 30%</li>
						<li> final exam: 50%</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>EEP II</h3>
